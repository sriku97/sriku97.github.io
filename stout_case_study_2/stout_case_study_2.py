customer_orders = pd.read_csv('casestudy.csv')

#Dropping Index
customer_orders = customer_orders.drop(customer_orders.columns[0],axis=1)


# ##### Suspecting that the text values in customer_email has extra leading spaces which might cause issues in calculations.

# In[4]:


customer_orders.groupby('customer_email').nunique()


# In[5]:


customer_orders['customer_email'] = customer_orders['customer_email'].str.strip()
customer_orders.groupby('customer_email').nunique()


# ##### There are some whitespaces in the email column that have now been removed. This will ensure more accurate calculations.

# ##### Moving on to the problem statements:

# ## 1) Total revenue for the current year

# In[6]:


customer_orders.groupby('year').agg({'net_revenue':'sum'})


# ## 2) New Customer Revenue e.g., new customers not present in previous year only

# In[7]:


#Create cumulative count ordered by year i.e. if customer A is new in 2015, assign 1
#and if customer A is present in 2016 assign 2 and so on

customer_orders['cum_count'] = customer_orders.sort_values(['year','customer_email']).groupby('customer_email').cumcount()+1

#This variable cum_count will be useful for other problems too!

customer_orders[customer_orders['cum_count']==1].groupby('year').agg({'net_revenue':'sum'})


# ## 3) Existing Customer Growth. To calculate this, use the Revenue of existing customers for current year â€“(minus) Revenue of existing customers from the previous year
# ## and
# ## 5) Existing Customer Revenue Current Year
# ## and
# ## 6) Existing Customer Revenue Previous Year

# ##### I'm not completely clear on the question 3. I have assumed that the question means: (Revenue of non new customers in current year) - (Revenue of those particular customers from the previous year)

# In[8]:


#Filter out the existing customers (cumulative count != 1)
#For each customer email in the list, left join the previous year's revenue
#Calcuate difference between current revenue and previous year's revenue as growth

customer_orders_left = customer_orders.copy()
customer_orders_right = customer_orders.copy()

#Adding 1 to year so that previous year's revenue is joined to the current year's revenue
customer_orders_right['year'] = customer_orders_right['year'] + 1
customer_orders_left = pd.merge(customer_orders_left[(customer_orders_left['cum_count']!=1)], customer_orders_right, on=['customer_email','year'], how='left')
