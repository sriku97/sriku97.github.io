      	Horror is one of the genres that best create visual imagery in the readers' minds. Such stories are well built in terms of the setting. Abandoned houses seem to be a favourite choice of setting for most authors of this genre. A house has multiple regions to it, and most writers make good use of the various locations in the house. Texts which have multiple such regions would help the reader visualise the map of the house, and the various incidents associated with each region.
      	This particular novel was chosen purely based on the number of incidents happening across multiple locations. For the purposes of the exercise, such a text is extremely helpful when it comes to splitting the plot across a map of various locations in the region.

      	The process of breaking the story into events was simple in this case. For the most part, events do not happen simultaneously and hence it is easy to go with the flow of the events as it is in the story. First, a summary of the story was written. The details of the story that were irrelevant to the outcome of the story or the character development were discarded. A number for the events describing the whole story was fixed at 20. Then, the summary was further reduced to specific incidents based on location. Events happening one after another were clubbed as one event. Another factor that was considered was the distribution of the events across the full story. This was done to avoid putting multiple events at the start of the story and running short towards the end.

      The process of map making was straightforward. The various locations were identified, and a rough map of the house was drawn. The accuracy of the drawing might not be accurate. It is meant to visualise the various locations in the house. After breaking the story into various events, each event was mapped to one location. Each event is displayed sequentially by the click of a button. The map remains static, while each event is displayed in the corresponding portion of the map.
